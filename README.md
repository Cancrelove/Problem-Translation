# HydroOJ Problem Translation Project

> English | [简体中文](/README-zh.md)

The project commit to translate problems written by Chinese in HydroOJ to English.

Previously, most non-Chinese speakers did not know the well-known OI problems written by Chinese before. Therefore, we want to help more non-Chinese speakers read these problems through the project.

Thanks to [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), it will give you a T-shirt when you have send 4 pull requests to any Github repositories in October.
